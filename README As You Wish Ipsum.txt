		As You Wish Ipsum Generator
*****************************************************

Greetings!

Thank you for your interest in my project.

The As You Wish Ipsum generates lorem ipsum text
based on the 1987 movie, The Princess Bride.

The quotes are from the movie, not the book of the
same name.

		Using This Project
*****************************************************
I welcome anyone to use this project. Please include
a link on your webpage or project back to my site:

http://codingbychad.com

Or not. But it would be cool for you to give credit
where it is due.

*****************************************************
		The Files Used
*****************************************************
The HTML file aywi_github.html is the HTML framework
for the generator.

The asyouwish.js file contains the code to execute
the ipsum generator.

The other files (bootstrap.min.js, jquery.js,
and bootstrap.min.css) are more
general functional files for BootStrap and jQuery
to work properly.

The slate.css file is a BootSwatch Theme file for
appearance of the website. You can download that file
or another theme of your choice at:

https://bootswatch.com/

The asyouwish.js file contains the array of Princess
Bride quotes. If you want to add additional quotes, you
may do so. Please note the format for the array in JS is

arrayName = { "arrayValue1", "arrayValue2", "arrayValue3", 
"etc" }

The getPBQuotes() will work if you add or remove quotes.
The function uses the length of the array as the limiting
variable for the random number generator. Any changes to 
the array lenght are already considered in the code.

I hope you enjoy this project. It's my first!! So please
leave any comments, questions, or kudos. I'll do my best
to answer your questions.
